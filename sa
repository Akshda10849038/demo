Project Milestone 2 - Create an end to end CI/CD pipeline in AWS platform using Jenkins as the orchestration tool, Github as the SCM, Maven as the Build tool, Deploy in a docker instance and create a Docker image, Store the docker image in ECR, Achieve Kubernetes deployment using ECR image. Build a sample java web app using maven.
Process:
Objective: Build & deploy a sample Java web app with Maven, containerize it with Docker, push the image to Amazon ECR, and deploy to Kubernetes—fully automated via a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, with infrastructure actions orchestrated by Ansible and shared artifacts on EFS.
Tools used: 
•	SCM: GitHub (main branch, webhook to Jenkins)
•	CI/CD Orchestrator: Jenkins controller with two agents:
o	build agent: Java 8 + Maven
o	docker agent: Docker CLI + aws CLI + kubectl
•	Amazon EFS (mounted to Jenkins paths for sharing build outputs/config)
•	Amazon ECR (public or private):to store images.
•	Kubernetes (EKS), deploying a Tomcat-based app from ECR image
•	Configuration management: Ansible for package install, user/perm setup, EFS mounts, and service files
AWS SERVICES AND THEIR PURPOSE
•	Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
o	To create a secure, isolated network environment for all resources (EC2, EFS, EKS).
o	Provides subnets, route tables, and networking for the pipeline infrastructure.
•	Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
o	To host Jenkins controller and agents for build and deployment tasks.
o	Compute instances for Jenkins orchestration, Maven build, Docker image creation, and Kubernetes operations.
•	Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
o	To share files (source code, build artifacts) between Jenkins controller and agents.
o	Acts as a centralized storage accessible by multiple EC2 instances.
•	Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
o	To store and manage Docker images securely.
o	Repository for the application image built by Jenkins before Kubernetes deployment.
•	Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
o	To deploy and manage the containerized application in a scalable, orchestrated environment.
o	Runs Kubernetes cluster for production-grade deployment.
•	AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
o	To manage permissions and roles for EC2, ECR, and EKS access.
o	secure access control for Jenkins and agents.
